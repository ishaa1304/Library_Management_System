**Library Management System**


**Overview**

The City Library Management System is a web application designed to facilitate the management of a city library. It provides features for both library patrons and administrators to browse, borrow, and return books, as well as  book inventory

**Features**
1. User Registration and Authentication: Users can register for an account and login securely to access library services.
2. Browsing Books: Users can browse the available books in the library and view details such as title, author, and availability.
3. Borrowing Books: Authenticated users can borrow books from the library. The system keeps track of borrowed books and their due dates.
4. Returning Books: Users can return borrowed books to the library.

**Architecture**
1. Backend Framework: The application is built using Flask, a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.
2. Frontend: HTML templates are rendered using Jinja2, a templating engine for Python. CSS is used for styling, and JavaScript is used for client-side interactivity.
3. Database: The application uses a MySQL database to store information about books, users, and borrowing transactions. SQLAlchemy is used as an ORM (Object- 
   Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the database.
4. Authentication: User authentication is implemented using session-based authentication

**Setup Instructions**
1. Install Python and Flask.
2. Set up a MySQL database server (e.g., using XAMPP).
3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt.
4. Run the Flask application (app.py).
5. Access the application in a web browser.

**The cart icon is also a button to view borrowed books.
You can also add books using add books feature.
If users have borrowed all copies of one book it will show you that the book is out of stock.**
